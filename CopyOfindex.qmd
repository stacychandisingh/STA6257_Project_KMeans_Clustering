## Introduction: What is K-Means Clustering?

- An unsupervised machine learning technique

. . .

- K-means is a fixed number (k) of clusters in a dataset

![](resources/clusterexample.png){fig-alt="cluster" width=750}

. . .

- Used to draw conclusions about a dataset based on groups of similar variables

. . .

- Different ways to determine the 'k'

## Our focus?

- Used a Spotify dataset focused on attributes (examples: tempo and popularity) surrounding a music track to group similar features by clustering them together

. . .

- We want to enhance our listener experience by recommending popular songs with similar song attributes to the favorite songs that they enjoy.


## Methods: diving into the K-Means algorithm

::: panel-tabset
## Assumptions
 
- K-means assumes the clusters are symmetric, there can be asymmetrical clusters. <br>
- The data is assumed to be independent. <br>
- Properly scaled data is important for K-Means, it can lead to uneven clusters. <br>
- There is a fixed number of clusters for K-Means. <br>

## WCSS

- Descriptive statistics/histograms/correlation matrix to visualize the spread of the data.

- Preprocess and scale data for ease of comparability.

- Libraries used: tidyverse, cluster, and factoextra. 

- The Euclidean distances are calculated to get the clustering distances measurement

- The distance data is visualized using the fviz_dist() function in R from the factoextra package. 


$$WCSS = \sum_{i=1}^{K}\sum_{j=1}^{ni}\left \| x_{ij} - c_{i} \right \|^2$$

- K is number of clusters. <br>
- n~i~ is number of data points in cluster i. <br>
- C~i~ is centroid. <br>
- X~ij~ is the *j*^th^ data point in cluster I. <br>

The WCSS can be used to measure how the data within a cluster are grouped. The variables that are used from the dataset are then scaled. Then, after they are scaled the next steps are:

## Euclidean distance

Euclidean distance is calculated between each attribute, and the cluster center:
$$ D_{euclidean}(x, Ki) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}((x_{i}) -(k)_{ij})^{2}} $$

Where: <br>

- x is data point. <br>
- k~i~ is cluster center. <br>
- n is number of attributes. <br>
- x~i~ is the *i*^th^ attribute of the data point. <br>
- K~ij~ is the *j*^th^ attribute of the centroid of cluster i. <br>

## Analysis and Results: Data and Vizualisation
Data source: [Spotify data from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/clustering-with-k-means/data?select=spotify.csv)

::: panel-tabset
## Data Description

For our segmentation we will be using a spotify dataset that contains the audio features of each of track. There are 32,828 observations across 22 variables. There are 12 numerical variables and 10 character variables.

| Variables | Description |
|--|-------------|
'Track_id'| Spotify ID for each track.<br>
'track_name'| Name of the Track.<br>
'track_artist'| Artist Name.<br>
'track_popularity'| The popularity of each track measured 1-100.<br>
'track_album_id'| Key specific to each album.<br>
'track_album_name'| Name of track.<br>
'track_alblum_release_date'| Date Album was released <br>
'playlist_name'| Style of music track can be found in.Contains genre and subgenre.<br>
'playlist_id'| Key to the style category.<br>
'playlist_genre'| Main category of each playlist.<br>
'playlist_subgenre'| Secondary category of each playlist.<br>
'danceability'| A well a track is for dancing through a combination of tempo, rythm, beat, and regularity on a scale between 0 and 1.<br>
'energy'| Energy is a measure between perception and energy measured between 0 and 1.<br>
'key'| The musical key the track is in.<br>
'loudness'| How loud the track is in decibels (dB).<br>
'mode'| Whether the scale is major or minor.<br>
'speechiness'| The level of spoken words in a track (similar to a podcast or talk show) measured on a level of 0 to 1.<br>
'acousticness'| How confident we are the track is acoustic on a scale of 0 to 1.<br>
'instrumentalness'| Determines the lack of vocals in a track.<br>
'liveness'| Listens for an audience in the track. This is determined on a scale of 0 to 1.<br>
'valence'| The musical positiveness conveyed in a track. Measured on a scale of 0 to 1.<br>
'tempo'| The tempo of a track measured in beats per minute.<br>
'duration_ms'| The duration of the track in milliseconds.<br>


## Data Preprocessing

```default
#convert tibble to data frame
spotify_df <- as.data.frame(spotify_df)

spotify_df <- spotify_df %>% select(-track_id, -playlist_id, -track_album_id) %>% 
  mutate_at(c("playlist_genre", "playlist_subgenre", "mode", "key"), as.factor)

# Check for missing data. 5 missing values found for three variables. 
colSums(is.na(spotify_df))

# Omit missing values
spotify_df <- na.omit(spotify_df)

# Verify missing data has been removed
colSums(is.na(spotify_df))

# Convert duration to minutes (from milliseconds)
spotify_df <- spotify_df %>% mutate(duration_ms = duration_ms/60000) %>% rename(duration_min = duration_ms)
head(spotify_df)
```

## Results

::: panel-tabset

## Covariance

- Covariance is a statistical measure revealing the relationship between variables. 
- Positive numbers indicate a positive relationship, such as the positive number at loudness and energy, telling us that as the loudness increases in a track so does the energy. 
- In the other direction, the higher the negative number the smaller correlation that is involved, such as the difference between loudness and acousticness.

![](resources/correlationnumbers.png){fig-alt="Covariance values" width=750}

## Correlation Matrix

![](resources/corrplot.png){width=750}

In the correlation plot, the darker the blue the greater the correlation between the variables. The chart shows a positive correlation between energy and loudness and a negative correlation between acousticness and energy.

## Histogram

- Histogram of variables to assess distribution and normality

![](resources/histogram.png){width=750}

## Popular Genres

![](resources/populargenre.png){width=750}

We want to gain an understanding of which genre is the most popular among our datset. To start we split the tracks between popular (1) and unpopular (0) based on a popularity score of over 57 (based on a score of 0-99). We filter out all of the unpopular songs and build our graph by playlist genre. We see that pop, latin, and rap have the highest count of popular songs in our review.

## Visualizing the data clusters

::: panel-tabset
## The Elbow Curve

- The point at which the line starts to curve is where we get our "k" clusters. Hence the name "Elbow Curve"
- The visual will shown a bend “elbow” due to the increasing value of K decreasing the number of datapoints. This bend is the indicator of the ideal number of clusters for our model.
- In our plot, we see that 3 is the ideal number of clusters, meaning there are 3 centroids to determine where the data points will fit the closest too.

## Cluster plot
- Three distinct clusters are shown here.

## What did we find?

::: panel-tabset

## Clusters

- In cluster 1, there are 2,292 records. 

- In cluster 2, there are 1,263 records.

- In cluster 3, there are 3,010 records.

## Centroid

## BSS/TSS Ratio

- The ratio of between-cluster sum of squares (BSS) to total sum of squares (TSS). 

- This measurement shows how well spread the clusters are between a value of 0 and 1. 

- The closer to 1, the more distinct the clusters are within the dataset. 

- In our model, the BSS/TSS ratio is 0.2042409, which is a pretty low ratio for this type of model. However, we determine a low number of clusters was sufficient in this model, which would also result in a low BSS/TSS ratio.

**BSS/TSS Ratio: 0.2039852**

## Review

![](resources/popularitygraph.png){width=750} 

We would like to see the number of popular songs in each cluster. Just like our previous analysis we take our spotify review set and see the number of popular tracks in each cluster based on our popularity score of >57. 
- In cluster 1, there are 492 popular tracks. 
- In cluster 2, there are 405 popular tracks. 
- In cluster 3, there are 1,241 popular tracks. 

The graph compares the groups as we use this new only_pop data to see what type of popular tracks are in each cluster.

## Cluster 1
![](resources/cluster1.png){width=550 height="315" fig-align="left"}   ![](resources/clustergraph1.png){width=560 height="315" fig-align="right"}
 

In our k means clustering model, cluster 1 has the highest duration_min, energy, instrumentalness, liveness, loudness, and tempo. These are fast and upbeat songs that include Blinding Lights, Crazy Train, and Sweet Child of Mine. The majority of genres are pop, rock, and EDM, which make up our most popular groups. These sounds are low on acousticness, dancebilitity, speechiness, and valence. This cluster also has the lowest number of popular tracks.



## Cluster 2

![](resources/cluster2.png){width=550 height="315" fig-align="left"} ![](resources/clustergraph2.png){width=560 height="315" fig-align="right"}

In our k means clustering model cluster 2 has the highest danceability, speechiness, valence, and the highest number of popular songs for our clusters. These are cheerful and vocal songs that include Memories, Falling, and everything I wanted as its top songs. The majority of genres are pop, latin, and rock. These sounds are low on duration_min, dancebilitity and instrumentalness.


## Cluster 3

![](resources/cluster3.png){width=560 height="315" fig-align="left"} ![](resources/clustergraph3.png){width=560 height="315" fig-align="right"}

Cluster 3

In our k means clustering model cluster 3 has the highest acousticness. These are soft rock or acoustic songs that include Roxanne, The Box, and Circles. These sounds are low on energy, liveness, loudness, and tempo. This cluster is very close to having the lowest number of popular track, and the top genres are latin, rap, and pop.

## Conclusions

- K-Means provides a simple yet insightful way to glean data insights.

- Unsupervised machine learning finds hidden data structures from an unlabeled dataset and its aim is to find the similarities within the data groups.

- Three cluster groups were found.

- We can offer song recommendations based on this analysis

- We recommend using other K-Means clustering methods to verify whether results are similar.
